## Customization

Feel free to customize the assistant to align with your preferences and requirements. The code is modular and easily extensible, allowing you to modify greetings, add new commands, or enhance existing features.

## Integrating OpenAI API with Environment Variables

For a more secure integration of OpenAI API keys, consider using environmental variables to store and access these keys. This approach ensures that API keys are kept confidential and allows for easy deployment on different machines.

### Steps to Integrate OpenAI API with Environment Variables (Windows)

1. **Get OpenAI API Key**: Obtain an API key from OpenAI by following their documentation.

2. **Open Environment Variables Settings**:
   - Click on the **Windows Start** button.
   - Type "Environment Variables" in the search bar and select the "Edit the system environment variables" option that appears at the top.

3. **Open Environment Variables Window**:
   - In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables..." button.

4. **Create a New User Variable**:
   - In the Environment Variables window, under the "User variables for [YourUsername]" section, click on the "New..." button.

5. **Set Variable Name and Value**:
   - Enter a desired name for the variable (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`) in the "Variable name" field.
   - Enter your OpenAI API key in the "Variable value" field.

6. **Save the Variable**:
   - Click "OK" to save the new user variable.
   - Click "OK" again to close the Environment Variables window.

7. **Access API Key in Code**:
   - In your Python code, access the API key using the `os` module:

     ```python
     import os

     openai_api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")

     # Use openai_api_key in your OpenAI API calls
     ```

8. **Run the Virtual Assistant**:
   - Run your virtual assistant, and it will now utilize the OpenAI API key stored as an environmental variable.
